# hourly_ozone_model
This repository contains the hourly-level ozone estimation model based on geostationary satellite (and polar-orbit satellite for comparison) and other processing codes supporting the findings of article "Unraveling Overestimated Exposure Risks Through Hourly Ozone Retrievals from Next-Generation Geostationary Satellites".

Due to the data storage limit of Github, we are not able to upload the full model (~65MB). We demonstrate here the trained model with simplified dataset. It is strongly encouraged with the original dataset refered in the manuscript.
